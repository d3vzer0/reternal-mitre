---------------------

RE:TERNAL is a centralised purple team simulation platform. Reternal uses agents installed on a simulation network to execute various known
red-teaming techniques in order to test blue-teaming capabilities. The simulations are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This repo contains configuration files that map reternal commands to MITRE techniques. The current techniques are based on the existing META configuration  (https://github.com/uber-common/metta) but reformatted to support reternal's internal command scheduler (+ implemented several structual changes to the format). The script to directly import the mapping files to the reternal backend is available in the Quickstart repository.

#### Component installation
